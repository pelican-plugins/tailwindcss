This plugin helps you use [Tailwind CSS][] in your Pelican web site.

## Why Use This Plugin?

Because you want use [Tailwind CSS][] in seconds. Not hours.

## Requirements

In order to run this plugin, you need to install Node.JS. (Someday this dependency could be replaced with a Python package.)

## Installation

This plugin can be installed via:

    python -m pip install pelican-tailwindcss

As long as you have not explicitly added a `PLUGINS` setting to your Pelican settings file, then the newly-installed plugin should be automatically detected and enabled. Otherwise, you must add `tailwindcss` to your existing `PLUGINS` list. For more information, please see the [How to Use Plugins](https://docs.getpelican.com/en/latest/plugins.html#how-to-use-plugins) documentation.

## Basic Usage

1. Create a `tailwind.config.js` file in your Pelican project root folder containing:

    ```js
    /** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
    module.exports = {
    content: ["./themes/**/*.html", "./themes/**/*.js"],
    theme: {
        extend: {},
    },
    plugins: [],
    };
    ```

    The `content` property values are just suggestions. Feel free to modify them according to your needs.

2. Create a `input.css` file in your Pelican project root folder containing:

    ```css
    @tailwind base;
    @tailwind components;
    @tailwind utilities;
    ```

3. Add the build file (`output.css`) in your `base.html`.

    ```html
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/output.css" />
    ```

4. Done! You should be ready to use [Tailwind CSS][] in your website template.

## Advanced Usage

In your settings you can configure the plugin's behavior using the `TAILWIND` setting.

An example of a complete `TAILWIND` setting:

```python
TAILWIND = {
    "version": "3.0.0",
    "plugins": [
        "@tailwindcss/typography",
        "@tailwindcss/forms",
        "@tailwindcss/line-clamp",
        "@tailwindcss/aspect-ratio",
    ],
}
```

### Tailwind Plugin Installation

As you can see from the example above, it is possible to add the `plugins` property to the configuration.
Just add the name of a Tailwind plugin to the list, and the plugin will be installed.

## Useful Information

### Plugins

Your `tailwind.config.js` file will only be copied when Pelican starts. This means that any changes made after starting Pelican will not be recognized. For example, if you want to install a new plugin for Tailwind, you will have to restart Pelican in order for that plugin to become active.
