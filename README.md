This plugin helps you use [Tailwind CSS][] in your Pelican web site.

## Why Use This Plugin?

Because you want use Tailwind CSS in seconds. Not hours.

## Requirements

This plugin is tested on Tailwind CSS 3.0.24. If you would like to add support for Tailwind CSS 4.0+, please submit a pull request along with appropriate additions to the test suite.

## Installation

This plugin can be installed via:

    python -m pip install pelican-tailwindcss

As long as you have not explicitly added a `PLUGINS` setting to your Pelican settings file, then the newly-installed plugin should be automatically detected and enabled. Otherwise, you must add `tailwindcss` to your existing `PLUGINS` list. For more information, please see the [How to Use Plugins](https://docs.getpelican.com/en/latest/plugins.html#how-to-use-plugins) documentation.

## Basic Usage

1. Create a `tailwind.config.js` file in your Pelican project root folder containing:

    ```js
    /** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
    module.exports = {
    content: ["./themes/**/*.html", "./themes/**/*.js"],
    theme: {
        extend: {},
    },
    plugins: [],
    };
    ```

    The `content` property values are just suggestions. Feel free to modify them according to your needs.

2. Create a `input.css` file in your Pelican project root folder containing:

    ```css
    @tailwind base;
    @tailwind components;
    @tailwind utilities;
    ```

3. Add the build file (`output.css`) in your `base.html`:

    ```html
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/output.css" />
    ```

4. In your Pelican settings, specify the target Tailwind CSS version via the `TAILWIND` setting:

    ```python
    TAILWIND = {
        "version": "3.0.24",
    }
    ```

5. Done! You should be ready to use Tailwind CSS in your web site templates.
