Release type: minor

* Fix NPM error (`could not determine executable to run`), perhaps related to Tailwind CSS 4.x release ([#8](https://github.com/pelican-plugins/tailwindcss/pull/8/))
* Use PDM & Ruff instead of Poetry, Black, Flake8, and isort ([#9](https://github.com/pelican-plugins/tailwindcss/pull/9/))
